## 🚀 How to Test & Fix Installation

### Step 1: Deploy Your App
```bash
# Make sure your app is deployed and accessible
# Example URLs:
# - Vercel: https://your-app.vercel.app
# - Heroku: https://your-app.herokuapp.com
# - Custom domain: https://your-domain.com
```

### Step 2: Test Debug Endpoint
Visit: `https://your-app-url.com/debug`

This will show you:
- Current environment configuration
- Whether all required variables are set
- Proper URLs for Partner Dashboard configuration
- Current request details

### Step 3: Configure Partner Dashboard
In your Shopify Partner Dashboard:

```
App Setup > App URL: https://your-app-url.com/
App Setup > Allowed redirection URLs: 
  - https://your-app-url.com/auth/shopify/callback
  - https://your-app-url.com/auth/callback
```

**CRITICAL:** Make sure your app is in **Development** mode, not Published!

### Step 4: Test Installation
1. Go to Partner Dashboard
2. Click "Test on development store"
3. Select a development store
4. Click "Install"

### Step 5: Monitor Logs
Watch your app logs during installation:
```bash
# Vercel
vercel logs --follow

# Heroku  
heroku logs --tail

# Local development
npm start
```

You should see logs like:
```
Root route accessed with params: { shop: 'test-store.myshopify.com', ... }
Installation request from shop: test-store.myshopify.com
Request from Shopify Partner Dashboard detected
Redirecting to OAuth: /auth/shopify?shop=...
OAuth initiation with params: { shop: 'test-store.myshopify.com', ... }
Starting OAuth for shop: test-store.myshopify.com
Generated OAuth URL: https://test-store.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/authorize?...
```

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Still Redirects to App Store
**Cause**: App is in Published mode or wrong URL configuration

**Solution**:
1. Check Partner Dashboard > Distribution > Change to "Development"
2. Verify App URL is exactly: `https://your-domain.com/`
3. Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue 2: No Logs Appearing
**Cause**: App URL in Partner Dashboard is wrong

**Solution**:
1. Test debug endpoint: `https://your-app-url.com/debug`
2. Update Partner Dashboard App URL to match
3. Make sure app is accessible from internet

### Issue 3: OAuth Errors
**Cause**: Environment variables not set or incorrect

**Solution**:
1. Check `/debug` endpoint for environment status
2. Verify `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` and `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET_KEY`
3. Restart app after setting variables

### Issue 4: SSL/HTTPS Errors
**Cause**: App not served over HTTPS

**Solution**:
1. Ensure your app is deployed with valid SSL
2. Test: `curl -I https://your-app-url.com/`
3. Use ngrok for local development: `ngrok http 3000`
